      <p>Romania, 1989. Cristian Florescu is seventeen and dreams of becoming a writer. But in his country, ruled by the cruel dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, people are not free to dream. Life is full of fear, lies, and secrets. When the secret police force Cristian to become an informer, he faces a terrible choice: stay silent and protect his family, or speak out and risk everything. Cristian decides to fight back in the only way he can—by using his words to tell the truth. As the country begins to rise up, Cristian joins the fight for freedom. But freedom comes at a cost. Is he ready to pay it?
